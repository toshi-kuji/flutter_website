## System requirements

To install and run Flutter,
your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:

- **Operating Systems**: macOS
- **Disk Space**: 2.8 GB (does not include disk space for IDE/tools).
- **Tools**: Flutter uses `git` for installation and upgrade. We recommend
  installing [Xcode][], which includes `git`, but you can also 
  [install `git` separately][]. 

{{site.alert.important}}
  If you're installing on an [Apple Silicon Mac][], you must have the Rosetta
  translation environment available for [some ancillary tools]. 
  You can install this manually by running:
  ```terminal
  $ sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
  ```

## Platform setup

macOS supports developing Flutter apps for iOS, Android, macOS itself 
and the web. Complete at least one of the platform setup steps now,
to be able to build and run your first Flutter app.
