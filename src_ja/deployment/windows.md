title: Build and release a Windows desktop app
description: How to release a Flutter app to the Microsoft Store.
short-title: windows
---

One convenient approach to distributing Windows apps
is the [Microsoft Store][microsoftstore].
This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough
of packaging and deploying a Flutter app in this way.

{{site.alert.note}}
  You are not required to publish Windows apps through the
  Microsoft Store, particularly if you prefer more control
  over the distribution experience or don't want to deal
  with the certification process. The Microsoft documentation
  includes more information about traditional installation
  approaches, including [Windows Installer][msidocs].

## Preliminaries

Before beginning the process of releasing
a Flutter Windows desktop app to the Microsoft Store,
first confirm that it satisfies [Microsoft Store Policies][storepolicies].

Also, you must join the
[Microsoft Partner Network][microsoftpartner] to be able to submit apps.

## Set up your application in the Partner Center

Manage an application's life cycle in the
[Microsoft Partner Center][microsoftpartner].

First, reserve the application name and
ensure that the required rights to the name exist.
Once the name is reserved, the application
will be provisioned for services (such as
push notifications), and you can start adding add-ons.

Options such as pricing, availability,
age ratings, and category have to be
configured together with the first submission
and are automatically retained
for the subsequent submissions.

## Packaging and deployment

In order to publish an application to Microsoft Store,
you must first package it.
The valid formats are **.msix**, **.msixbundle**,
**.msixupload**, **.appx**, **.appxbundle**,
**.appxupload**, and **.xap**.

### Manual packaging and deployment for the Microsoft Store

Check out [MSIX packaging][msix packaging]
to learn about packaging
Flutter Windows desktop applications.

Note that each product has a unique identity,
which the Store assigns.

If the package is being built manually,
you have to include its identity details
manually during the packaging.
The essential information can be retrieved
from the Partner Center using the following instructions:

1. In the Partner Center, navigate to the application.
2. Select **Product management**.
3. Retrieve the package identity name, publisher,
   and publisher display name by clicking **Product identity**.

After manually packaging the application,
manually submit it to the
[Microsoft Partner Center][microsoftpartner].
You can do this by creating a new submission,
navigating to **Packages**,
and uploading the created application package.

### Continuous deployment

In addition to manually creating and deploying the package,
you can automate the build, package, versioning,
and deployment process using CI/CD tooling after having submitted
the application to the Microsoft Store for the first time.

#### Codemagic CI/CD

[Codemagic CI/CD][codemagic] uses the
[`msix` pub package][msix package] to package
Flutter Windows desktop applications.

For Flutter applications, use either the
[Codemagic Workflow Editor][cmworkfloweditor]
or [codemagic.yaml][cmyaml]
to package the application and deploy it
to the Microsoft Partner Center.
Additional options (such as the list of
capabilites and language resources
contained in the package)
can be configured using this package.

For publishing, Codemagic uses the
[Partner Center submission API][partnercenterapi];
so, Codemagic requires
[associating the Azure Active Directory
and Partner Center accounts][azureadassociation].

## Updating the app's version number

With Flutter Windows desktop,
the version number must be set during the
packaging process and can not be set using
the `pubspec.yaml` or command line arguments.

The default version number of the app is `1.0.0.0`.

{{site.alert.note}}
  Applications are not allowed to have a
  Version with a revision number other than zero.
  Therefore, the last number of the version must
  remain zero for all releases.
  Ensure that you follow Microsoft's
  [versioning guidelines][windowspackageversioning].
{{site.alert.end}}

## Add app icons

To update the icon of a Flutter Windows
desktop application before packaging use the
following instructions:

1. In the Flutter project, navigate to
   **windows\runner\resources**.
2. Replace the **app_icon.ico** with the desired icon.
3. If the name of the icon is other than **app_icon.ico**,
   proceed to change the **IDI_APP_ICON** value in the
   **windows\runner\Runner.rc** file to point to the new path.

When packaging with the [`msix` pub package][msix package],
the logo path can also be configured inside the `pubspec.yaml` file.

To update the application image in the Store listing,
navigate to the Store listing step of the submission
and select Store logos.
From there, you can upload the logo with
the size of 300 x 300 pixels.

All uploaded images are retained for subsequent submissions.

## Validating the application package

Before publication to the Microsoft Store,
first validate the application package locally.

[Windows App Certification Kit][windowsappcertification]
is a tool included in the
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

To validate the application:

1. Launch Windows App Cert Kit.
2. Select the Flutter Windows desktop package
   (**.msix**, **.msixbundle** etc).
3. Choose a destination for the test report.

The report might contain important warnings and information,
even if the certification passes.
